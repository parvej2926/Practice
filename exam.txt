BEST OF LUCK



1.⁠ ⁠suppose you have a file with few strings . (one string in one line )
file name: stling.txt

write a code that will print the words in such a manner that the string with the highest length will be at the top .

example: 

input:                    output:

tuli                    musharrof
parvez                  parvez
das                     gupta
gupta                   tuli
musharrof               das

hint: use stl

    2. suppose you have txt file named text.txt. the file contains numbers ,alphabets , and special characters . (all are in the same line )

write a code that will store numbers, alphabets and special characters in diffferent stl library and print them. (you are no allowed to use set library)

example: 

input:                      output:
                            
tuli 12 % $ 90 parvez       file1.txt: tuli parvez       file2.txt: 12 90       file3.txt: % $
    
hint: use stringstream

    3. suppose your text containts some extra letters. 
write a code to remove the previous  letter if it encounters '#'.

example: 

input:                                          output:

myy# naaaa###meee## ii#ss# tuuu##liii##.        my name is tuli.

input:                                      output:

BOARD:DHA ROLL:2926 NAME:PARVEZ UNI:CU      valid

BOARD:Dha 2926 NAME:PARVEZ UNI:CU           invalid

    5. make a makefile to combine all the codes.
